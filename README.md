# voice-command-app
This repository demonstrates how to create a voice-activated command system using Python. The system listens for specific commands and responds accordingly using text-to-speech (TTS) and speech recognition.

## Features
- Voice recognition using the SpeechRecognition library
- Text-to-speech conversion using the pyttsx3 library
- Command execution based on recognized speech

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using the following command:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/melihteke/voice-command-app.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the following script to start the voice-activated command system:

```pyhton
python main.py
```

## Notes
The script includes commented-out lines for changing the voice. Uncomment and modify as needed.
